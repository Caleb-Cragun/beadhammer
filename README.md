# What is this BeadHammer?
BeadHammer is a site featuring creations made of perler beads used as stand-ins for Warhammer 40k models. 

## Why Perler Beads?
When I was introduced to the hobby, I didn't have a lot of extra funds to spend on getting models. However, I did have a ton of extra perler beads (and quite a bit of extra time). So, putting my time and beads to work, I made a custom army for wargaming in the Grimdark Future. For in the grim darkness of the far flung future, there is only beads...and war.

## What can you expect to find?
Here, I'll feature models that I've put together using ideas and designs that I've found on pinterest, as well as some self made designs. Also, I'll have a guide on making the comparable size bases for your models.
